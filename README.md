# Task_manager
This program is designed for a small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.

The program will ask the user to enter a user name and password. These are storred in a user text file. Initially only the administrator's user name and password is storred in user text file. Once the administrator has logged in they are presented with a list of choices. They can resister a new user by creating a user name and password, which is storred in the user text file. They can add a task to a user, they can view all the tasks, they can view their own tasks or they can exit the program. The tasks and users assigned to tasks are storred in a tasks text file. Once a new user has been registered by the administrator, the new user can log in with their user name and password. The user will not be able to register a new user, only the administrator will be able to do that. Once the user has logged in they will be presented with a menu which consists of, assigning a new task to a user, viewing all the tasks, viewing tasks assigned to that user or exiting the program. Assigning a new task consists of entering a person to assign the task to, the title of the task, a discription of the task, the date the task was assigned, the date the task is due and whether the task is complete or not.

This program is for small companies who need a simple program to manage their team.

The goal of the project is to creat an easy to use program for a small business to manage their team.
